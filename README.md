## My first C# RPA project

After reading the challenge requirements, I knew that this was going to be my first encounter with this type of challenge and technologies.  I have never used C#, C++ or Java, and decided to go with C# because I have learned that it is a powerful, flexible, well supported, and one of the most popular and modern programming languages available today.

* My first step was to figure out how to START building a console application in C# so, I researched and found very useful documentation from NSS’ GitHub repos.

* I installed C# in my Visual Studio Code and also installed .NET on my computer.

* Then I tested ‘dotnet’ in my terminal and it worked.
* After that I made a directory, cd into my project, then ran the dotnet new console and I was very excited to see that I had created my first C# project.

* My first line of code was “Hello World” and found that I needed to use dotnet run to see it in the terminal and it worked!  I was on my way to finally START researching more about how to even begin coding this project.

* I talked to mentors/instructors/students and googled a lot and found Selenium.  I choose Selenium because first of all, I have never used C# before, and second because I needed to complete this project in a timely fashion.  From what I read about Selenium, which is used to automate browsers, didn’t seem too complicated. Locating or finding elements by id, class, tag name, path, CSS, etc. and using the elements/browser operations seemed like the best choice for me.

* Next, I had to figure out what I needed to install to get Selenium working.
* It took me some time and finally found that I needed to install Selenium.Support, Selenium.WebDriver, and Selenium.Webdriver.ChromeDriver in my project through the terminal. I also installed NUnit but later found that I didn’t need it.

* After having everything needed installed in my program, I had to test it out.
* So I started with googling/learning how to instruct the browswer to navigate to the specified URL.  I found two different ways

* I ran my program through the terminal and I had an issue with the version of selenium.webdriver.chromedriver and chrome did not launch.

* I did some research and found that I had installed an older version than what I needed, I quickly installed the newest version and that fixed the problem.

* I watched tutorials and searched for the Selenium commands/methods/operations (not sure what the correct terminology is) and started with step 1.

* I used my Chome Dev Tools to inspect the webpage and find the correct tag name, id, class, etc in order to make it work.


####  * I commented my code so you can read my thought process in program.cs
